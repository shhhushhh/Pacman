CSSI Extension Friday Project: Pacman
=================

Your Project
------------

### ← README.md

Not much to say other than it's a scuffed version of Pacman :D I mainly worked on creating the world array, the drawMap() function, and implementing the coins.
You can play the game on the Glitch IDE: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/pacman-sample

### ← index.html

Focused mainly on exploring the p5 library in Javascript so not much emphasis was placed on html or css 

### ← style.css

See html

### ← script.js

Utilized the p5 library in Javascript to create our version of Pacman! This was a timed project and we completed it in around 3 hours.

### ← assets

There are several assets (including the ghosts which have not been implemented yet) included.
